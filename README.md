# Sublime Snippets for Unity Messages

Snippet for most of the messages used by Unity 5 classes. Feel free to open pull requests or issues for the missing ones, I'll be adding them as needed.

These files are expected to be a Sublime package as soon as I feel they are good enough.

These files were generated from my old completions file. Check [this gist](https://gist.github.com/JulioC/1583858d6a288028debd) for more info.
